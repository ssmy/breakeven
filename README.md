Breakeven - flexible cost splitting application

This is a fairly simple cost-splitting application that works on a surprisingly hard to grasp principle. There is a common pool of money, and each transaction splits the amount between the beneficiaries evenly. Over time, all participants break even with minimal work.

Technology
==========

The application is just PHP using the redbean ORM to simplify database work. There is currently no admin interface, users must be added via mysql directly.
